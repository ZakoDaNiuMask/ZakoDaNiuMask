/**
 * The type ladder a page's own text is written against. The family is never set here - it comes
 * from the active [MaterialTheme.typography], where the font the user picked is applied - and how
 * a line breaks is part of a token, so a long word hyphenates instead of overflowing its box.
 *
 * The steps are tuned for this manager rather than taken from Material: 17sp titles, 15sp
 * summaries and 14sp captions over generous line boxes. A tighter scale read as too small on a
 * large-screened device, while the Material page sizes read as too loose for a settings-style
 * list. Each line box keeps the same gap over its text, so only the size moves.
