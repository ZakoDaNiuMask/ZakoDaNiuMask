/*
 * Mount-view hiding.
 *
 * Two mount-based root probes are defeated here:
 *   1. A classic isolated process that inherits AID_READPROC (gid 3009) and reads
 *      every process's /proc/<pid>/{mountinfo,mounts,mountstats} - it flags module
 *      marker substrings AND a differential (distinct mount views vs propagation
 *      classes).
 *   2. An Android 17 zygote_next native isolated process that reads its OWN
 *      /proc/self/mountinfo but from init's GLOBAL namespace, where the module
 *      mounts are still present.
 *
 * We do NOT strip AID_READPROC, do NOT unmount in a shared namespace, and do NOT
 * spoof the Groups line - any of those is itself a non-stock deviation. Instead we
 * filter the per-record 'show' output of the three mount files, keyed on the READER
 * (current), applied uniformly to its own file and every pid it reads. Because the
 * same set of records is removed from every view, views never diverge and the
 * differential probe cannot fire; because it works by filtering (not unmounting) it
 * is safe in the global namespace too. procfs reports st_size == 0 for these files,
 * so removing records leaves no size tell.
 *
 * The kernel-side umount path (feature/kernel_umount.c) is kept as-is for classic
 * private-namespace apps; this filter is complementary.
 *
 * HIDE DECISION - three complementary matchers.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * Both probes parse the WHOLE rendered mountinfo line and match markers anywhere in
 * it - crucially in the mount-root field (field 4, e.g. "/adb/modules/...") and in
 * the super-/mount-options (overlay "lowerdir=/data/adb/..."), not just the
 * mountpoint. So the primary matcher lets the ORIGINAL show function render the record
 * into the seq_file buffer, then scans exactly those bytes; on a marker hit we rewind
 * m->count to erase the record. This mirrors the probes byte-for-byte on the mountinfo
 * format.
 *
 * The text scan alone is NOT enough for /proc/pid/mounts and mountstats: those formats
 * omit the mount-root field, so a module bind mount (e.g. bindhosts binding
 * /adb/modules/.../system/etc/hosts onto /system/etc/hosts) renders with only a
 * block-device source and no visible marker. Two format-independent backstops cover it:
 *   (a) a match of the record text against the registered umount list
 *       (feature/kernel_umount.h) - the mountpoint appears in every format; note this
 *       list is empty when kernel_umount is disabled, so it cannot be relied on alone;
 *   (b) inspection of the mount's real root dentry path (ksu_mnt_root_hidden), which
 *       reveals /adb/modules/... regardless of the printed format and needs no umount
 *       list. It allocates a page and computes a dentry path, but only for a non-fs-root
 *       mount (IS_ROOT short-circuits the common whole-filesystem case).
 * To avoid over-hiding stock submounts, coarse/stock ancestors are never used for the
 * umount-list match (see ksu_region_has_mount_list()).
 */

/*
 * View of the kernel's `struct proc_mounts` (fs/mount.h, private header).
 *
 * Only the first three members - ns, root, show - are touched here, and their
 * order/type is ABI-stable across every GKI version this fork targets
 * (5.10 / 5.15 / 6.1 / 6.6 / 6.12). We never allocate one of these, never index
 * past ->show, and only ever dereference ->show on a kernel-allocated object.
 *
 * The `struct mount cursor;` tail was added in commit 9f6c61f96f2d (v5.8-rc1), so
 * ALL supported targets (>=5.8) carry the cursor layout; the older
 * `void *cached_mount; u64 cached_event; loff_t cached_index;` tail existed only
 * before 5.8, which this fork does not target. Either way the head (ns/root/show)
 * is identical and the tail is never accessed, so we deliberately omit it - it
 * embeds `struct mount` by value, whose layout is __randomize_layout and whose
 * header (fs/mount.h) is kernel-private.
