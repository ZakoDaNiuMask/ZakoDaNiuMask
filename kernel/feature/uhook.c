/*
 * uhook - general kernel-mediated userspace instrumentation via uprobes,
 * exposed through KSU_IOCTL_UHOOK (see uapi/supercall.h).
 *
 * A hook is keyed by (file inode, file-offset), so it applies to every thread
 * and process that maps the file and is immune to ASLR. This is the
 * persistent/automatic counterpart to the interactive HWBP-hold in ptctl.
 *
 * A hook = where (entry or uretprobe return) + when (condition) + what (action),
 * with an optional register capture drained via KSU_UHOOK_READ.
 *
 * VISIBILITY -- read this before believing a hook is invisible. A uprobe's
 * mechanism IS a modified instruction byte: uprobe_write_opcode() writes BRK #5
 * into a private COW copy of the target's own text page. It does not touch the
 * file on disk and it does not set TracerPid, but the target reading its own
 * .text (directly, via /proc/self/mem, or via PEEKTEXT) sees the BRK, so a
 * self-checksum over its own mapping WILL fire. Two further tells: once any
 * probe hits, /proc/<pid>/maps grows a `[uprobes]` line, and /proc/<pid>/smaps
 * reports a non-zero Anonymous: inside an r-xp file mapping that normally has
 * none. (Anonymous:, not Private_Dirty: -- the COW'd text page is accounted
 * clean on android14-6.1, measured at 4 kB Anonymous / 0 kB Private_Dirty.)
 *
 * SCOPE -- filter_tgid is mandatory and ADD refuses 0. It used to be documented
 * as "0 = every process that maps the file", which is exactly what both gates
 * below implemented, and an unscoped hook is wrong in three separate ways. It
 * plants the BRK in every mapper, so the tells above appear in zygote,
 * system_server and anything else holding the file open, and the patched page is
 * then inherited across fork. It lets an unrelated mapper break the hook you
 * actually wanted: register_for_each_vma() assigns rather than ORs
 * install_breakpoint()'s result, abandons the remaining mms on the first error,
 * and __uprobe_register() then unwinds the whole consumer -- with one approved
 * mm that cannot happen, with every mm approved it is one exiting process away.
 * (That one is at least loud: the error reaches uh_add(), which fails the ADD.)
 * The third is not. uprobe_register() reports success whether it planted the
 * breakpoint in fifty address spaces or in none, so a hook armed nowhere lists
 * as active and reads exactly like a probe site the target never reaches.
 * Naming the process fixes the first two by construction; uh_mapped_count()
 * answers the third.
 *
 * What 0 was NOT is a gate that matched nothing: both gates below implemented it
 * as documented and an unscoped hook does fire -- measured, ten hooks on a
 * target-only library gave identical results scoped and unscoped, and one
 * unscoped hook on libc's open() fired in 16 processes including the target.
 * It fires and then buries itself: 6996 records in eight seconds against the
 * target's own 8, through one 512-record ring that drops the oldest, so a drain
 * afterwards showed none of the target's. An empty ring was never evidence
 * about the filter.
 *
 * CONTROL FLOW -- on the uprobe core a handler-set pc does NOT survive an ENTRY
 * site. After handler_chain(), handle_swbp() single-steps the probed
 * instruction out of line and arch_uprobe_post_xol() unconditionally resets pc
 * to (probed address + insn length); at an arm64 site the decoder simulates
 * instead, arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() re-reads pc AFTER the handler and feeds the
 * corrupted value to the simulator as the branch base, which is worse -- the
 * thread lands at a wild address. FORCE_RET/JUMP/SKIP and SETREG-of-pc are
 * therefore REJECTED at an entry site (-EOPNOTSUPP) instead of silently
 * misbehaving.
 *
 * At a RETURN site the picture is the opposite: handle_swbp() recognises the
 * trampoline and tail-calls handle_trampoline(), which sets pc =
 * ri->orig_ret_vaddr and only then runs the ret_handlers, with no single step
 * afterwards. JUMP and SKIP are reliable there, and SETREG of x0 genuinely
 * forges the function's integer/pointer return value -- the canonical "make a
 * check report success" bypass. (It cannot forge an FP/SIMD return: pt_regs
 * carries no v-registers. A large struct returns through the x8 indirect
 * pointer, so x0 is not what the caller reads.) FORCE_RET is rejected at a
 * return site too: x30 still holds the trampoline address there, so honouring
 * it re-enters a return_instance that has already been freed and ends in
 * force_sig(SIGILL).
 *
 * ON_RET also requires `offset` to be the function's FIRST instruction: arm64's
 * arch_uretprobe_hijack_return_addr() steals x30, not a stack slot, so a
 * mid-function offset hijacks whatever LR happens to hold.
 *
 * Portability. Register access is implemented for arm64 and x86_64 (the module
 * is built for both); other arches fall back to no-ops so it still links. The
 * uprobe ABI moved twice. v6.12 merged the ref_ctr_offset argument into
 * uprobe_register(), which now returns a struct uprobe *, split
 * uprobe_unregister() into _nosync/_sync, and dropped the uprobe_filter_ctx
 * argument from the filter. v6.13 added the session-consumer cookie, so handler
 * and ret_handler each gained a trailing __u64 *data. Each era is handled below.
 * The cookie is unused here: a hook installs exactly one of the two handlers and
 * uprobes.c takes `session = uc->handler && uc->ret_handler`, so a hook is never
 * a session consumer, and a ret_handler-only consumer still gets its return
 * instance prepared. All ops are root-gated by the supercall perm check; kernel
 * entry points are resolved via kallsyms so this links whether built in or as an
 * LKM.
